# Daniel Zimmermann's Professional_Portfolio

## Challenge 2 Description

No code was given for the creation of my own personal professional portfolio.
All HTML and CSS were added from scratch. Thanks to Qing (TA) and Simon (Tutor) for their help with figuring out my styling.

- HTML Nav links to sections and Resume Doc
- Footer Contact info links to my personal pages on various apps
- CSS to style with header/nav, hero, about me and work sections, and footer.
- Clickable application backgrounds that link to posted web apps (some COMING SOON).
